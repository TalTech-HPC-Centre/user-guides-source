  abstract = {Many scientific and engineering disciplines are now relying on or are supplemented by large scale numerical simulations or data analysis. These fields include physics, chemistry, CFD, climate and ocean modeling, pollution transport, virus spreading, building modeling and training for deep learning and big data analysis. This requires access to suitable high performace, high throughput or parallel computing environments.\\  Some of these fields can largely benefit from data parallel architectures like GPUs, others are better suited for regular CPUs.\\  TalTech's HPC center provides a heterogeneous environment suitable for diverse applications.}
