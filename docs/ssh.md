# Getting SSH keys to work

SSH keys fingerprint is a security feature for easy identification/verification of the host, user is connecting to. This option allows to connect to the server without a password. On first connect, user is shown a fingerprint of a host-key, and asked if it should be added to the list of known hosts.

Please compare the fingerprint to the ones below, if one matches, the host can be added, if the fingerprint does not match, then there is a problem (e.g. man-in-the-middle-attack).

## Generating  SSH keys 

---

In **Linux/Mac** SSH keys can be generated in cmd by command:

```bash	
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
	
In **Windows** SSH keys can be generated in powershell by command:

```powershell	
	ssh-keygen.exe -t rsa
```
	
The program prompts the user through the process and asks the user to set a passphrase, which should be created. This process ends with two keys in the path it showed. One of them is named (by default) `id_rsa` and the other `id_rsa.pub`. The `.pub` key is your public key, the other is a private key.

***NB! Never share your private key with anyone.***

## Uploading SSH keys to base

---

Once the keys are created, the public (`.pub`) key needs to be uploaded to base. There are a couple of ways to do it. On base, SSH public keys are found in `/etc/AuthorizedKeys/$USER` file, there is a link to it from `.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

Several SSH keys can be used simultaneously to access the same user account in case of use several different devices. 

On **Linux/Mac** to copy keys to the cluster:

```bash
	ssh-copy-id Uni-ID@base.hpc.taltech.ee
```

_**where uni-ID should be changed to user's uni-ID.**_
	
![ssh-keygen](pictures/ssh-key_3.png)	
	
On **Windows** it can be copied in powershell with this command:

```powershell
	type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh Uni-Id@base.hpc.taltech.ee "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

_**where uni-ID should be changed to user's uni-ID.**_
